Week 2

**What is reinforcement learning?**
<br/>The agent interacts with the environment, and receives a reward or penalty each time it takes a certain action. By repeating this process, the agent learns a strategy that maximizes reward.

**Main components**
<br/>1. Agent: The entity that learns and makes decisions 
<br/>2. Environment: The world that the agent interacts with 
<br/>3. State: Information about the current situation 
<br/>4. Action: The choices the agent can make 
<br/>5. Reward: Feedback for each action
